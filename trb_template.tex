% ---------- Abstract ----------
\section{Abstract}
The Transportation Research Board (TRB) has unique requirements for manuscripts submitted for review. These can make \LaTeX\ workflows fiddly, and no existing style perfectly mirrors the guidelines. This template offers a pragmatic starting point for authors using \LaTeX\ (and related literate programming tools) while matching TRB conventions.

% ---------- Introduction ----------
\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
The Transportation Research Board (TRB) currently requires submissions of full papers to be considered for presentation at the TRB Annual Meeting \cite{trbwebsite}.  The Instructions For Authors website (\url{https://trb.secure-platform.com/a/page/TRBPaperReview}) outlines specific requirements for submissions. Initial submissions are PDFs, while accepted papers for the \textit{Transportation Research Record} may require Microsoft Office formats. Manuscripts must be line-numbered; captions are bold with TRB-specific punctuation; in-text citations are numbered and the reference list is ordered numerically. See the author information online at \url{https://trb.secure-platform.com/a/page/TRBPaperReview}.

We assume basic familiarity with \LaTeX\ and \verb|bibtex|. As literate programming becomes more common, the template may evolve to support additional workflows.


\subsection{History}
David R. Pritchard \cite{pritchard} released the original template in 2009 and updated it in 2011. Gregory S. Macfarlane \cite{macfarlane} extended it in 2012 (Sweave integration and auto counts). C.\ Ross Wang \cite{wang} automated total word count calculation and improved formatting in 2015, added GitHub releases in 2016, and provided \TeX-only variants in 2017 (\url{https://github.com/chiehrosswang/TRB_LaTeX_tex}) and an RNW version (\url{https://github.com/chiehrosswang/TRB_LaTeX_rnw}). The 2019 and 2025 updates focused on the \TeX-only version: the 2019 update improved Overleaf compatibility, while the 2025 update enhanced word-counting and authorship blocks.

% ---------- Features ----------
\section{Features}
This template targets quick and TRB-compliant manuscript assembly \cite{trbwebsite}.

\subsection{Title Page}
The class provides a custom \verb|\maketitle| that prints authors (via \verb|\TRBauthor|), a word count (with tables counted as 250 words each by default), and the submission date. Word counting uses \verb|texcount| via shell escape; compile with \verb|--shell-escape| (see \customref{the BUILD section}{sec:build}).

\subsection{Page Layout}
Margins are 1~in. The running header shows authors (set with \verb|\AuthorHeaders|) at the left and the page number at the right. Headings and spacing follow TRB conventions.

\subsection{Line Numbers}
Line numbering uses the \verb|lineno| package and resets each page. Blank lines are not numbered. The \verb|numbered| class option enables line numbers.

% ---------- Captions ----------
\subsection{Captions}
Figure~\ref{fig:trial} shows a Gumbel distribution as an example. Figure captions use sentence case.  Table captions use Title Case and function as a short title. Table~\ref{tab:versions} summarizes the template history.  Both Figure and Table captions are bold.

\end{table}

% ---------- Bibliography ----------
\subsection{Bibliography}
Use \verb|trb.bst|. The command \verb|\citep{}| prints authors with the reference number; \verb|\cite{}| prints only the number. References appear in numerical order.

Examples include \citep{Bierlaire2003,Bierlaire2008,Garrow2009,Koppelman2005} and grouped numeric citations \cite{Bierlaire2003,Garrow2009,Koppelman2005}.

% ---------- Equations ----------
\subsection{Equations}
Equations are left aligned with no extra indentation. Below is the Intelligent Driver Model (from \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_driver_model}).

\begin{align}
  & \dot{x}_\alpha = \frac{\mathrm{d}x_\alpha}{\mathrm{d}t} = v_\alpha,\\
  & \dot{v}_\alpha = \frac{\mathrm{d}v_\alpha}{\mathrm{d}t}
  = a\!\left( 1 - \left(\frac{v_\alpha}{v_0}\right)^\delta
      - \left(\frac{s^*(v_\alpha,\Delta v_\alpha)}{s_\alpha}\right)^2 \right), \\
  &s^*(v_\alpha,\Delta v_\alpha)
  = s_0 + v_\alpha T + \frac{v_\alpha\,\Delta v_\alpha}{2\sqrt{a\,b}}\,.
\end{align}

% ---------- Section Referencing ----------
\subsection{Referencing Sections by Custom Names}
Because this template does not use section numbering, referencing
sections directly can be difficult. To address this, you can create
hyperlinks to labeled sections with your own display text using the
\verb|\customref| command: \verb|\customref{Displayed Text}{label}|.

For example, if you have defined \verb|\label{sec:intro}| for the
Introduction section, you can write
\verb|\customref{INTRODUCTION section}{sec:intro}|
to produce a hyperlink that appears as
\customref{INTRODUCTION section}{sec:intro}.

% ---------- Conclusion / Build ----------
\section{Conclusion and Build}\label{sec:build}
To build with automatic word counting:
\begin{verbatim}
    latexmk trb_template.tex -pdf -pvc -shell-escape
\end{verbatim}
The \verb|--shell-escape| flag lets \verb|texcount| run for accurate totals.

Perl is required for \verb|texcount| (e.g., ActivePerl: \url{http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads}).
