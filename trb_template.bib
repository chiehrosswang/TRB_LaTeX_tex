By employing Constraint Programming (CP) technology and optimization solution mechanism to construct inspection scheduling model, and the objective is to minimize time consumption of the road inspection. The province and county roads in Douliou city are chosen as examples for analysis, plans out best routes for inspection process, and also displays all the road sections passed by inspection vehicle. Thus this model can be used as reference to support the authorities to efficiently allocate resources for the inspection process, and achieve the objective as shorten the inspection time consumption.}

 abstract = {The time dependent vehicle routing problem (TDVRP) is defined as follows. A vehicle fleet of fixed capacities serves customers of fixed demands from a central depot. Customers are assigned to vehicles and the vehicles routed so that the total time of the routes is minimized. The travel time between two customers or between a customer and the depot depends on the distance between the points and time of day. Time windows for serving the customers may also be present. The time dependent traveling salesman problem (TDTSP) is a special case of the TDVRP in which only one vehicle of infinite capacity is available. Mixed integer linear programming formulations of the TDVRP and the TDTSP are presented that treat the travel time functions as step functions. The characteristics and properties of the TDVRP preclude modification of most of the algorithms that have been developed for the vehicle routing problem. Several simple heuristic algorithms are given for the TDTSP and TDVRP without time windows based on the nearest-neighbor heuristic. A mathematical-programming-based heuristic for the TDTSP without time windows using cutting planes is also briefly discussed. Test results on small, randomly generated problems are reported.},

abstract = {The paper is concerned with the optimum routing of a fleet of gasoline delivery trucks between a bulk terminal and a large number of service stations supplied by the terminal. The shortest routes between any two points in the system are given and a demand for one or several products is specified for a number of stations within the distribution system. It is desired to find a way to assign stations to trucks in such a manner that station demands are satisfied and total mileage covered by the fleet is a minimum. A procedure based on a linear programming formulation is given for obtaining a near optimal solution. The calculations may be readily performed by hand or by an automatic digital computing machine. No practical applications of the method have been made as yet. A number of trial problems have been calculated, however.},

@article{Gracia2014,
abstract = {Pruning is a cultural operation linked to Mediterranean agricultural management and it offers through its wastes the chance to procure biofuels. Currently, these residues are disposed of by burning or shredding, not being exploited because of several technical difficulties in extraction, handling and transport as well as because of the lack of accurate data on the quantity and suitability of these residues. However, recent work has reported methods of supplying new biomass detection models and concentration locations. These make it possible to tackle reliable collection plans as a part of the decision support system in a biomass supply management information system. This paper addresses the biomass collection problem, as an application of the classical vehicle routing problem, where minimum cost routes have to be calculated for a fleet of several agricultural vehicles (chippers, trucks, tipper trailers and tractors). A hybrid approach based on genetic algorithms and local search methods is presented to solve a real case study. Results show a significant improvement in the operational efficiency obtained by applying such methods that come from the industrial engineering domain. {\textcopyright} 2014 IAgrE.},

@article{Choubane2013,
abstract = {The Florida Department of Transportation has historically used a combination of handheld devices and visual surveys to evaluate the retroreflectivity of pavement markings. However, visual surveys have the inherent limitations of operator bias, while the use of a handheld device is slow and labor intensive and presents safety hazards. Many highway agencies have recognized that a mobile retroreflectivity unit (MRU) may be a safer and more efficient alternative to the handheld retroreflectometers. Because the measurement process relies on the operator-driven instrument, a level of uncertainty is always a concern in evaluating pavement markings with the MRU. This research was aimed at assessing the precision and bias of the MRU while using the handheld retroreflectometer as a reference device. Ten 1.0-mi-long field sites were selected to include various pavement surface types and pavement marking materials (paints and thermoplastics). The results indicated that, when compared with the handheld retroreflectometers, the MRU demonstrated no statistical differences or bias at a 95{\%} confidence level for the retroreflectivity values ranging between 200 and 800 mcd/m(2)/lux. In addition, it was determined that the retroreflectivity values from two properly conducted tests using a single MRU on the same pavement marking should not differ by more than 7.8{\%}, and when different MRUs were used on the same pavement marking, the retroreflectivity values should not differ by more than 13.3{\%}. This paper presents a description of the testing program, the data collection effort, and the subsequent analyses and findings.},

abstract = {The mobile retrorefleetometer unit (MRU) has been recognized by highway agencies as an appealing alternative to handheld retroreflectometers because of its improved safety and efficiency. Over the past 4 years, the Florida Department of Transportation has been researching the use of the MRU for evaluating pavement markings continuously and reliably at traffic speeds. Because the stripe surface is nonuniform and the measurement process relies on the operator-driven instrument device, there is some uncertainty in evaluating pavement markings with the MRU. As part of the broader effort for MRU implementation, this research assesses MRU precision in repeatability for pavement marking retroreflectivity. Six designated sections of roadway were selected at random for testing on various pavement surfaces and pavement stripes (paint and thermoplastic). Retroreflectivity data were collected only on the white edge lines of the test sites. The survey limits were selected so that the effect of nonretroreflective-related variables, such as breaks in the pavement markings, inclines, declines, and curves in the roadway, could be minimized. The data were analyzed to determine the pavement marking characteristics at each test location for retroreflectivity at 80 km/h (50 mph) using the reduced 30-m geometry standard. Results indicated that the retroreflectance values from two properly conducted tests using the same MRU on the same pavement marking should not differ by more than 20.1 mcd/m(2)/lux or 6.7{\%} at a 95{\%} confidence level for retroreflectivity values ranging between 200 and 450 mcd/m(2)/lux.
